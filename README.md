# **uConnect**
The aim of our program is to create a website to help combat prejudice by connecting individuals with potential friends and employers based on personality compatibility rather than surface level factors. To do this, character personality and career personality assessments will be conducted to assign individuals a specific archetype in each category. After an archetype is assigned, individuals will be able to explore all of the archetypes, common obstacles each archetype may face & suggestions on how to overcome those obstacles, as well as have their data saved & displayed in a results database for potential friends and employers to find and explore.
